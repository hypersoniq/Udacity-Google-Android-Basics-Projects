# SQLite it up, Android World!

This is my eighth official project created for the
[Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 "Udacity Android Basics ND")

It is a book store inventory app that must use SQLite3.

## NOTE:
This is currently not working due to some as yet unlocated error when constructing the database... more to come.

## Thanks for visiting!
