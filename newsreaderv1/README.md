# Read All About It, Android World!

This is my sixth official project created for the
[Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 "Udacity Android Basics ND")

It is a news reader app that must use JSON data returned from the API of the Guardian news service.

## NOTE:
The search query is simply "fake news", hence the app title "Real Fake News Reader v1". There will be a v2 which will incorporate an options menu, but that will be a different project

## Thanks for visiting!
