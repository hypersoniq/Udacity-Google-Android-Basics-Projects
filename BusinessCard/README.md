# Hello Android World!

This is my first official project created for the
[Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 "Udacity Android Basics ND")

It is a simple fictional business card application that contains a separate activity_main.xml file for both portrait and landscape orientations.
The clickable Address, phone number and email are created in the XML with the android:autoLink property.

## NOTE:
This is a FICTIONAL business with a bogus telephone number, though the address maps in google to the Grand Strand regional airport. The email is mine, so feel free to pass along any comments or suggested improvements if you happen to find this app.


I wonder why Android Studio makes you jump through the layout-land hoops... there should be a more intuitive way, right?
## Thanks for visiting!
