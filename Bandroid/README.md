# Keep on rockin' in the Android World!

This is my fourth official project created for the
[Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 "Udacity Android Basics ND")

It is a framework for a music player app. It does not play music, but does mimic the behavior of an app that does. ALL songs, bands, albums and artwork are made up for this project.
