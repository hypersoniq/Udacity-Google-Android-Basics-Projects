# Hello Again, Android World!

This is my second official project created for the
[Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 "Udacity Android Basics ND")

It is a score keeper for American Football. It allows the user to track all possible scoring types for two teams. A reset button is included at the bottom of the app. 

## NOTE:
This app is LOCKED into portrait mode. There is no purpose served to redesigning the layout for landscape, and trying to add a ScrollView to this particular project wasted large chunks of time that I cannot get back...

## Thanks for visiting!
