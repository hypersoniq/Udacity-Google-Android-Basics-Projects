# Finally functional, Android World!

This is my ninth and final official project created for the
[Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 "Udacity Android Basics ND")

It is a book store inventory app that must use SQLite3. It has been resubmitted for review after addressing all of the requested changes... 
waiting patiently for the results and the end of the course (or the next round of rework)...

Thanks Iva@Udacity for the help with the android:Focusable="false" addition to the list item button, it works as intended now!

## Thanks for visiting!
