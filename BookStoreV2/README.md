# Not quite ready for prime time, Android World!

This is my ninth and final official project created for the
[Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 "Udacity Android Basics ND")

It is a book store inventory app that must use SQLite3. It is a work in progress at the early stages
TODO list...
1. wire up all buttons (5 total in 2 different views)
2. incorporate logic that prevents the book quantity from going negative.
3. clean project
4. submit for review

Thanks Iva@Udacity for the help with the android:Focusable="false" addition to the list item button, it works as intended now!

## Thanks for visiting!
