# Not quite ready for prime time, Android World!

This is my ninth and final official project created for the
[Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 "Udacity Android Basics ND")

It is a book store inventory app that must use SQLite3. It is a work in progress at the early stages, main issues
1. "sell 1" button present but not wired up yet.
2. individual list items do nothing when clicked, though a click listener and an intent were established to do so... no errors reported, but app does not yet do what is needed.

## Thanks for visiting!
