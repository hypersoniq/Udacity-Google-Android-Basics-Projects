# reworking and currently broken, Android World!

This is my ninth and final official project created for the
[Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 "Udacity Android Basics ND")

It is a book store inventory app that must use SQLite3. It has been submitted for review... waiting patiently for the results!

Thanks Iva@Udacity for the help with the android:Focusable="false" addition to the list item button, it works as intended now!

## Thanks for visiting!
