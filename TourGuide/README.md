# Visit Myrtle Beach, Android World!

This is my fifth official project created for the
[Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 "Udacity Android Basics ND")

It is a Tour Guide app that has several categories (Attractions/ Dining/ Entertainment/ Shopping) of interesting places to visit in Myrtle Beach, SC and surrounding areas.

## NOTE:
This app contains many placeholder images to ensure that plagiarism did not happen. On my next visit to Myrtle Beach, I will try to get proper images for as many locations as I can.
... No matter how many trips it takes!

## Thanks for visiting!
