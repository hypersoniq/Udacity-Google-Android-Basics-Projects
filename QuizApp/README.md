# Third time is the charm, Android World!

This is my third official project created for the
[Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 "Udacity Android Basics ND")

It is a quiz app. The theme is computer technology. The keys to this app were to include radio buttons, check boxes and user input, then grade the quiz and report the score via a toast message. 

## NOTE:
This app immediately brings up your keyboard to get your username, at this time I am unsure how to override this behavior.

## Thanks for visiting!
